      <h2> Welcome to our website! </h2>
      <p> We are team #21658, better known as Thunder Wonder from Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Our journey began about two years
        ago during the Rookie Challenge in July 2022. during that time, we were a team cosisting of only seven member, now we 
        are a group of ten highly enthousiastic about robotics students in the 10th and 11th grade. This is our second year 
        participating in the FIRST Tech Challenge, last year being our first. Our main objective is to secure a ticket to the
        World Championships in America while also improving our 3D printing skills. Additionally, we aim to inspire the younger
        generation by visiting elementary schools and introducing them to the wonders of the FIRST Tech Challenge.
